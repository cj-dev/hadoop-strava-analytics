# What it is

A prototype for practicing hadoop-y mapreduce fundamentals

# Usage
In general, start with some data (JSON, 1 object per line). In this case, use segment_efforts.py to get every attempt on a segment over the last year. This requires a strava API key (included with a free account).

Test using `cat <filename> | python mapper.py | python reducer.py`

Expected results are some data on stdout and maybe some visualizations.
